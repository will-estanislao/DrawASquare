Draw A Square Version 1.0

	  *+*+A message from the programmer+*+*
++++++-----------------------------------------------------++++++
Hey, it's me, Will. The guy who made this program. Thanks
for checking it out. I pretty much made this program out on
a whim for fun. I've actually never done programming of this
kind before (GUIs). It's pretty rough and quickly
put together, but it pretty much does what I intended for it
to do. Draw squares. It doesn't quite look like what I 
originally had in mind, but I tend to always bite off more 
than I can chew with how I envision a lot of my programming 
efforts.

The drawsquare is a pretty simple program. Click the
"DRAW SQUARE" button, and tada- a square is born. 
Unfortunately, I had to cut a few things out for the 
sake of actually creating an executable file. Those 
things weren't really essential for the functionality of 
the program per se, but it was useful for those who 
hate reading readme.txt files (like myself lol).

Anyways some very quick explanation of the buttons:

> CLEAR  - Erases all squares drawn on the canvas. This
	   will NOT reset your position
> RESET  - Returns your pen back to it's original position (at [0,0]!)
> UNDO   - Go back to a previous action. Now this button doesn't undo the
	   the last square made. It will undo a single action. The way draw
	   square is structured, you will need to press this button approximately
	   8 times to erase a singular square (sorry...). Understandably tedious,
	   I know.
> DRAW   - Draw a square. Simple as that :^]
  SQUARE 
> ARROW  - These are directional buttons to navigate your cursor around the canvas.
  BUTTONS  The buttons operate similar to tank controls. "^" will move you forward.
	   "v" will move you backwards. "<" and ">" are used to turn right and left
	   respectively.
> COLOUR - This section is for colour. Pick from the amazing variety of 4 colours 
	   for your pen. Your pen will start on black, and to change colours, click
	   any of the 3 other colours available. The colour you pick will be indicated
	   by the button being pushed down and a pink filter overlay.
> PEN	 - Adjust the size of your pen by moving the slider either left or right.

And that's about it for the tutorial. So, this thing
was slapped together in about a day or two, so you
may (will) encounter bugs and errors. If so, please let
me know. I may have finished this and it's functioning
but it's not yet complete. Some errors/missing features
(to be fixed in the future) include:
- No boundaries, your pen will go out of the canvas bounds
- The undo button needing to do a turn before undoing the line
- The helpful little text boxes that pop up when you hover over
  stuff
- Mid square making you can actually move the pen in any direction
  (Debating on actually fixing this since it can be used for some 
   artistic purpose, I suppose)
- Save feature
- Make the UI aesthetics look nicer

Thanks for trying out the program! Hope you have fun making squares! :^]

**Oh yes I also included a little extras folder for those curious about
what this was actually originally supposed to look like along with some
of the pics of the icon
